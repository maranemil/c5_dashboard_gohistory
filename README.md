======================

C5 Dashboard Go History v0.1

A small "Fix" for Concrete5 Dashboard which provides a back history functionality.

This helps in Edit mode, when Administrator has something to edit in Dashboard and
than has to return to the page where was in the Website, instead of going to index
page every time when leaves the Dashboard Panel.
